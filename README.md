# ScrapeQuotes

ScrapeQuotes is a Python-based web scraping project that allows you to extract quotes, authors, and tags from the "Quotes to Scrape" website. Using web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup and Selenium, it enables you to gather a collection of inspirational quotes for analysis, data mining, or any other purposes.

## How It Works

The project utilizes the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML structure of the website and extract the desired information. Selenium is used for automating the login process and handling pagination. It navigates through the web pages, finds the relevant elements, and retrieves the quotes, authors, and tags.

## Prerequisites

To run the scraping scripts, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup library
- Selenium library
- A WebDriver compatible with your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome)

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```shell
pip install beautifulsoup4 selenium
```
